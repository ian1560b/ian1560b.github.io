it's been a long and enriching journey, albeit not an easy one. I have spent sleepless nights setting up this blog for almost two years, and my efforts are slowly starting to pay off, I think.

I need a little more time to wrap this up.

I'm also planning to join a community of people who are just setting up their blogs.
